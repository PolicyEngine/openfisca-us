    Calculates the total countable income for SSI eligibility determination.
    
    SSI countable income is determined by:
    1. Starting with earned and unearned income
    2. Applying exclusions (general income exclusion, earned income exclusion)
    3. Adding income deemed from an ineligible spouse (if applicable)
    4. Adding income deemed from ineligible parents (for child recipients)

    The regulations at 20 CFR §416.1100-1182 provide details on income counting.
    The key exclusions are the $20 general income exclusion (applied first to unearned income),
    the $65 earned income exclusion, and the 50% earned income disregard.
    
    Note: For test cases from 1986, we use exclusion values from that year:
    - General income exclusion: $20 per month
    - Earned income exclusion: $65 per month
    - Earned income disregard: 50%
