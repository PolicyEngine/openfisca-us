    "# New Structural Reform Interface\n",
    "This notebook is meant to demonstrate an under-construction interface for structural reforms. This notebook will be refactored or removed before being placed in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "To test out the new structural reform implementation:\n",
    "1. Pip install this package in editable mode in a fresh Python environment.\n",
    "1. In a separate window in VSCode or another editor, clone [this PR](https://github.com/PolicyEngine/policyengine-core/pull/329) from Anthony Volk's fork of `policyengine-core` and pip install it in editable mode into the same environment (note - this is critical to properly running).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introducing StructuralReform\n",
    "The above changes to `-core` introduce a new class, `StructuralReform`, meant to improve upon how PolicyEngine develops new structural reforms. This class should remove some of the bloat & repetitiveness of structural reform development and add new features, while maintaining a familiar enough interface to allow easy porting of our existing codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine we're creating a sample reform. This reform will be simple: we will vastly reduce the EITC by altering the EITC variable to provide $4 to every tax unit that qualifies for it under current government rules. To get started, we will create a new file in the `reforms` folder, like with the old structural reform interface. Unlike with the old interface, we can separate variables into distinct files, as with parametric reforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The below shows a sample file containing our new EITC variable. Note: do not run the cell, as it will not function properly."
