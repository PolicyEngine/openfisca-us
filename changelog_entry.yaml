- bump: minor
  changes:
    added:
    - The `net_capital_gains` variable (formerly `c23650`).
    - The `gov/irs/capital_gains/loss_limit.yaml` parameter file.
    - The `loss_limited_net_capital_gains` variable (formerly `c01000`) that uses the `loss_limit` parameter.
  removed:
    - Formula code that avoids `sep` variable that had no formula, and therefore, was likely to cause bugs.
  changed:
    - Rename taxcalc variables to be consistent with this project's coding style and to be in more sensible directory locations.
